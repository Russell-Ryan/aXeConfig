# h5aXeConfig

A python API for implementing aXe-style calibration and common grism functions.

## Installation

python setup.py install

## Calibration Files

To facilitate cameras with multiple detectors (such as WFC3/UVIS with its two CCDs), I felt it necessary to extend the ascii-formatted calibration files to a more advanced format.  I choose the [hdf5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) format, and have provided a few of the common detectors that I have worked with.  Given the file size, I provide these on a personal webpage.  **Therefore, one requires the h5py library.**

## Additional Details

For more information on the mathematics, please see the appropriate documentation for [aXe](URL), but also my paper on [LINEAR](URL) contains a basic grism primer ([Ryan, Casertano, & Pirzkal 2018, PASP, XXXXX](URL)).
